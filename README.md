## Some random text

So I made this hackintosh basically just for fun, but it seems kinda stable, so I use it as my dialy driver. I've never had crashes with it.  

Regarding the not working stuff: with some time I managed to fix almost everything, so only two things are not working, but none of them is a deal-breaker:
 - The brightness control keys are not working, eventhough I added and configured the Brightness Control kext. I kept it, as with a version upgrade they might fix it.
 - HDMI coldplug: I have no idea why is it happing... But I use a USB-C docking station, so it's not a problem at all for me. And the port itself works, just need a re-plugging, so...
